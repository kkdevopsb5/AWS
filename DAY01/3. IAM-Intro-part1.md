# IAM (Identity and Access Management) â€“ Introduction

IAM allows you to securely manage access to AWS services and resources. With IAM, you can create users, groups, and roles, assign permissions using policies, enforce password complexity, and manage access credentials.

When an AWS account is created, a root user is automatically provisioned. IAM enables the creation of individual users for secure and auditable access to AWS services, avoiding the use of the root user for everyday tasks.

# Step-by-Step: IAM User Creation (with Custom Password)

### Step 1: Open the IAM Console

Navigate to: [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)

### Step 2: Create a New IAM User

* In the left navigation pane, click on "Users"
* Click on the "Add user" button

### Step 3: Configure User Details

* Provide a unique user name (example: vianth-admin)
* Select "AWS Management Console access"
* Choose "Custom password"
* Enter a strong password or use the auto-generated option
* Optionally, enable "Require password reset" upon first login

### Step 4: Set Permissions

* Option 1: Use a group

  * Click "Create group"
  * Enter group name (example: AdminGroup)
  * Attach the "AdministratorAccess" policy
* Option 2: Attach existing policies directly

  * Choose "AdministratorAccess"

### Step 5: Add Tags (Optional)

You can define key-value pairs for user identification or billing purposes.

### Step 6: Review and Create

* Verify the user configuration
* Click "Create user"

After creation, the console will display:

* IAM Console Login URL
* Username
* Password (if manually set)

Store this information securely.

# IAM Console Login as New User

To log in using the new IAM user:

* Open the AWS console URL shown after user creation. Format:
  https\://\<account\_id>.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
  Example: [https://381491819887.signin.aws.amazon.com/console](https://381491819887.signin.aws.amazon.com/console)

* Enter:

  * Username (example: vianth-admin)
  * Password

* If forced password reset was enabled, the user will be prompted to set a new password on first login.

# Replace Account ID with Custom Alias

You can make the IAM login URL more user-friendly by replacing the account ID with an alias.

Steps:

1. Go to the IAM console
2. On the IAM dashboard, find "IAM account alias"
3. Click "Customize"
4. Enter a new alias (example: vianth-kk)
5. Click "Yes, Create"

The new login URL becomes:
[https://vianth-kk.signin.aws.amazon.com/console](https://vianth-kk.signin.aws.amazon.com/console)

# Configure Password Policy for IAM Users

To enforce security requirements across all IAM users:

1. In the IAM console, go to "Account Settings"

2. Under "Password policy", click "Set password policy"

3. Recommended settings:

   * Minimum password length (e.g., 8 characters)
   * Require at least one uppercase letter
   * Require at least one lowercase letter
   * Require at least one number
   * Require at least one non-alphanumeric character
   * Allow users to change their own password
   * Enable password expiration (e.g., every 60 or 90 days)
   * Prevent password reuse (e.g., last 3 passwords)

4. Click "Apply password policy"

These settings apply globally to all IAM users under your account.

# IAM User Security Credentials (Optional)

After user creation, you can optionally enable programmatic access for the IAM user:

* Go to IAM > Users > Select the user > "Security credentials"
* Click "Create access key"
* This will generate:

  * Access Key ID
  * Secret Access Key

These credentials are used for AWS CLI or SDK-based access. They should not be shared or stored in source code.

---

# Summary

IAM enables secure user access and permission control in AWS. It is essential to create individual IAM users instead of using the root user. Configure a password policy to enforce security standards and set a custom account alias for a cleaner login experience. IAM user credentials should be stored securely and monitored regularly.
