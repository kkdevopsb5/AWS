### IAM Policies in AWS

### Types of IAM Policies

### Custom IAM Policy:

* Allow S3 access only for specific bucket or user ID
* Deny S3 while allowing all other services

# IAM Policies in AWS

## What is an IAM Policy?

An IAM policy is a JSON document that defines permissions for an identity (IAM user, group, or role) or AWS resource. Policies control access by specifying:

- **Effect**: `Allow` or `Deny`
- **Action**: AWS service actions (e.g., `s3:PutObject`)
- **Resource**: Which resource the action applies to
- **Condition** (optional): Additional constraints (e.g., IP address, tag)

---

# Types of IAM Policies

1. **Managed Policies (AWS Managed)**
   - Predefined by AWS (e.g., `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`)
   - Easy to use but not customizable

2. **Customer Managed Policies**
   - Created by your organization
   - Fully customizable

3. **Inline Policies**
   - Embedded directly into a specific IAM user, group, or role
   - Tightly coupled with that identity

# Example 1: Custom Policy to Allow S3 Access to a Specific Bucket Only

This policy allows access **only to a specific S3 bucket** and nothing else in S3.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowS3AccessToSpecificBucket",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-company-logs",
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-company-logs/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
````

---

# Example 2: Policy with Condition â€” Allow S3 Access Only for a Specific IAM User

This policy allows access to `my-company-data` bucket **only if** the request is made by a specific user.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowS3ForSpecificUserOnly",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:*"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-company-data",
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-company-data/*"
      ],
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:userid": "AIDAEXAMPLEID123456:user1"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

To find the `aws:userid`, run this from the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws iam get-user --user-name user1
```

---

# Example 3: Deny S3 Access, Allow All Other Services

This is a **deny-first policy**, useful when you want to block S3 access explicitly even if other permissions allow it.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "DenyS3Access",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can attach this as an **inline policy** to a user or group. Since explicit deny overrides allow, the user will be blocked from all S3 actions but can still access other services as permitted by other policies.

# Best Practices for IAM Policy Design

* Always follow **least privilege**: grant only the permissions needed.
* Use **managed policies** for simplicity, **custom policies** for control.
* Add explicit **"Deny"** rules when enforcing critical restrictions (e.g., deny S3 for all users except backup job role).
* Use **conditions** for fine-grained control (e.g., IP-based, MFA required).
