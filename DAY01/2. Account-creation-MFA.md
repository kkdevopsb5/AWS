# First Steps After AWS Account Creation: MFA Setup for Root User

Once your AWS account is active, it's critical to **secure the root account** by enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

The root user has **unrestricted access** to all AWS services and billing. It must be secured immediately after account creation.

## What is MFA?

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds a second layer of protection to your account. In addition to the password, you’ll be required to enter a **time-based code** generated by an app or device.

## How to Enable MFA on Root User

### Step 1: Login as Root User

* Use the root email and password to sign in at: [https://console.aws.amazon.com/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/)

### Step 2: Navigate to IAM Service

* In the **AWS Management Console**, go to **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**
* Or open directly: [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)

### Step 3: Go to the Security Dashboard

* On the left panel, click **“Dashboard”**
* Look for the item **“Activate MFA on your root account”**
* Click **“Manage MFA”**

### Step 4: Choose MFA Type

* Select **Virtual MFA device** for mobile apps like:

  * Google Authenticator
  * Authy

### Step 5: Set Up the MFA Device

* Open your authenticator app
* Use the app to **scan the QR code** shown on the AWS console
* The app will now generate 6-digit codes every 30 seconds

### Step 6: Complete Setup

* Enter **two consecutive MFA codes** from the app
* Click **Assign MFA** and then **Finish**

## MFA Best Practices

* Use **hardware MFA** for production or enterprise environments
* Save backup codes or recovery information securely
* Always enable MFA on **both root and IAM users with admin access**
